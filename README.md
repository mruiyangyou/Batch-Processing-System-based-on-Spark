# Batch Processing System based on spark

This project provides a robust solution for batch processing using Apache Spark and Ansible for infrastructure management. For demonstration purposes, a sentiment analysis pipeline using the BERT language model has been deployed. Designed to utilize the power of distributed computing for NLP, the project comes in two parts: the application codebase for the text classification service and the infrastructure as code (IaC) using Ansible to set up and manage the Spark infrastructure.

## Getting started
